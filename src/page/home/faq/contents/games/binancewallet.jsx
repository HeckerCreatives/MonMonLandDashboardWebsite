            Is it okay if I have no Binance but have other wallets?
            </h2>
            <p>
            No, Monmonland only uses Binance as a means of transaction for easy use. Worry not, Monmonland Customer Service Support will be assisting players who want to learn how to create a Binance account. Transferring from other wallets are strictly prohibited inside the game for it may cause commotion and conflict on both parties.
